# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


### How to run this test suite

Go to https://github.com/fierytengoku/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader-master and download the repository.
Unzip to your desktop and inside you'll find an index.html file. Right-click and open in a browser of your choice. The page will load and the test suite will run. At the bottom will be a display indicating how many specs ran and how many failed. Have fun!
